            HTML5 is the fifth version of the HTML scripting 
            language. It supports a lot of new things that 
            older versions of HTML do not.
            For Example:
            In HTML5 there is something new called the 
            Semantic Elements. Semantic elements have
             meaningful names which tell about the type 
             of content: header, footer, navbar, â€¦ etc.            
            HTML5 introduces many semantic elements as 
            mentioned below, making the code easier to write a
            nd understand for the developer and instructing the 
            browser on how to treat them.
